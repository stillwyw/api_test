##INTRO

####Key components:
1. Grape: the api generator
2. Doorkeeper: the oauth2 provider, and protector.
3. Vue.js: is used to build a client side one page javascript application which imitates a client requesting resources.
4. ActiveAdmin: quick admin panel builder.

*`Vuejs` and `grape` is drawing a lot of attetions, recently. So I decided giving them a try with this project instead of `reactjs` + `Rails` as before. And this is the first time I've ever tried on these two, might took me some time to read the documents. :)*

####Local Installation 
`bundle install`
`rake db:migrate`
`rake db:seed` this is for generating the initial admin account: `admin@example.com`and `password`.

####Local setup
1. goto http://127.0.0.1:3000/oauth/application to create a application following the instruction. This will prompt you to login as admin.
2. copy the `client_id` to application.html.erb to replace the current existing one.
3. go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/sign_up to create a user. Note, you can login with `/users/sign_in` URI, but it won't give you access to the api. you still have to use this account to login on the javascript App to get access from there.
4. visi http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to start exploring the app and resources.

####API
